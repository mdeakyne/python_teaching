**DAY 16/21: Dash Core Components – Inputs & Controls** 🚀  

Today I explored **dcc components** in Dash — the building blocks that give users control over their data exploration experience. From dropdowns to sliders to date pickers, these tools transform a static dashboard into an interactive analytics hub.  

🎯 **Key Takeaway:** Thoughtful input controls turn your dashboard from a data display into a data *conversation*.  

💻 **What I Built:** I mocked up an interactive dashboard for *Page Turner Analytics*, our fictional bookstore chain, where users can filter sales trends by genre, highlight seasonal demand with date ranges, and adjust price analysis using sliders. Each control is connected to future callbacks — laying the groundwork for real-time, responsive charts.  

```python
import dash_core_components as dcc

dcc.Dropdown(
    options=[{'label': 'Fiction', 'value': 'FIC'}, {'label': 'Non-Fiction', 'value': 'NF'}],
    value='FIC'
)

dcc.DatePickerRange(start_date='2024-01-01', end_date='2024-06-01')
```

📈 **Progress:** 76% through the bootcamp — from curiosity-driven learner to confident Dash builder!  

🚀 **Tomorrow:** Callbacks — Making It Interactive (where these controls will finally “talk” to our charts).  

💬 **Question:** If you could add one interactive control to your favorite dashboard, what would it be and why?
