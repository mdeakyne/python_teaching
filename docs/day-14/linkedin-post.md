**DAY 14/21 – Mini-Project: Complete EDA Dashboard (Static)**  

Today I built a **static multi-chart EDA dashboard** — a full workflow from raw dataset to actionable insights. This exercise was a big step toward thinking like an analyst rather than just a coder.  

🎯 **Key Takeaway:** An effective dashboard doesn’t just display data — it tells a clear, visual story that drives decision-making.  

💻 **What I Built:** Using Python and Pandas, I generated summary statistics, visualized sales trends over time, highlighted the most popular genres, and analyzed customer ratings distributions. The dashboard combined multiple plots (bar charts, line charts, histograms) into a single layout for quick interpretation, giving management a “one- glance” view of retail performance.  

```python
# Example: Genre sales aggregation
genre_sales = df.groupby('Genre')['Sales'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False)

plt.bar(genre_sales.index, genre_sales.values)
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.title("Total Sales by Genre")
plt.show()
```

📈 **Progress:** 66% through the bootcamp — each project feels more like a real-world deliverable.  

🚀 **Tomorrow:** I’ll be diving into **Dash Fundamentals** to turn this static dashboard into an interactive web app.  

💬 **Question:** If you could track *only one KPI* for your business in a dashboard, what would it be, and why?
