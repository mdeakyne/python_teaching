**DAY 18/21 â€“ Advanced Layouts: Multi-page Dashboard ðŸš€**

Today I built **multi-page apps** with tabbed navigation, grid layouts, and responsive design â€” turning a single crowded dashboard into a smooth, navigable experience.  

ðŸŽ¯ **Key Takeaway:** Breaking complex dashboards into multiple pages improves usability *and* performance, making data exploration faster and more intuitive.

ðŸ’» **What I Built:**  
I created a *Page Turner Analytics* dashboard for a bookstore chain. Instead of cramming filters, graphs, and KPIs into one view, I split them into dedicated tabs: **Sales Overview**, **Inventory Trends**, and **Customer Insights**. Using Dash, I implemented a dynamic layout system with `dcc.Tabs` for navigation and CSS grids for a responsive feel across devices. Managers can now switch between sections without losing context or facing visual clutter.

```python
app.layout = html.Div([
    dcc.Tabs(id="tabs", value='sales', children=[
        dcc.Tab(label='Sales Overview', value='sales'),
        dcc.Tab(label='Inventory Trends', value='inventory')
    ]),
    html.Div(id='tab-content')
])
```

ðŸ“ˆ **Progress:** 85% through the bootcamp â€” only 3 days left!  

ðŸš€ **Tomorrow:** Integrating Pandas with Dash for *live filtering* and real-time insights.

ðŸ’¬ **Question for you:** If you could redesign a dashboard you use daily, whatâ€™s the *first* change youâ€™d make for a smoother workflow?
