**DAY 7/21 â€“ Time Series Basics: Daily Book Sales Trends ðŸ“šðŸ“Š**

Today I dove into **datetime parsing** and **time series indexing**â€”unlocking the power to transform raw sales data into meaningful trends over time. Resampling helped me aggregate daily totals into weekly summaries, and **rolling windows** revealed smoother patterns for easier interpretation.

ðŸŽ¯ **Key Takeaway:** Time-based analysis turns scattered transactions into actionable insightsâ€”helping businesses plan smarter for peaks and troughs.

ðŸ’» **What I Built:** I simulated daily book sales data for *Page Turner Analytics* and explored whether weekends outperform weekdays. By parsing dates accurately, resampling sales data, and applying rolling averages, I extracted patterns that could guide inventory decisions and marketing efforts.

```python
df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])
df.set_index('date', inplace=True)
weekly_sales = df['sales'].resample('W').sum()
rolling_avg = df['sales'].rolling(window=7).mean()
```

ðŸ“ˆ **Progress:** 33% complete in the bootcampâ€”building stronger skills each day.

ðŸš€ **Tomorrow:** *Matplotlib Basics*â€”turning these time-series insights into my first visual charts.

ðŸ’¬ **Question for you:** How has time-based data analysis helped you make better business or project decisions? Share your examplesâ€”Iâ€™d love to hear how you apply it!
