## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Basic Python knowledge (variables, functions, loops)
- `uv` installed ([installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/))

### Setup (Day 0)

**Why `uv`?** It's a blazing-fast Python package manager that handles installation, virtual environments, and dependencies automatically. No more `pip`, `venv`, or version conflicts!

```bash
# Install uv (if not already installed)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Clone or download the materials
cd python_teaching

# Add all bootcamp dependencies
uv add pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly dash jupyter

# Run Jupyter with the project environment
uv run jupyter lab

# Or verify installation
uv run python -c "import pandas as pd; print(f'pandas {pd.__version__}')"
```

**That's it!** `uv` automatically creates a virtual environment, installs Python 3.11+ if needed, and manages all dependencies.

### Start Day 1

Once you're set up, head to [Day 1: Environment Setup & Generating Synthetic Book Data](day-01/lesson.md) to begin your journey!

## 📂 Datasets

All datasets are provided in the `datasets/` folder:

- `books.csv` - Book catalog
- `authors.csv` - Author information
- `sales.csv` - Sales transactions
- `reviews.csv` - Customer reviews

These realistic datasets are completely synthetic and designed for educational use.
