# Day 1 – Environment Setup & Generating Synthetic Book Data  
**Week 1 | Beginner | Duration: 3-5 minutes**

---

## Introduction  
Imagine you’ve just joined **Page Turner Analytics**, a small but fast-growing company that helps bookstores understand customer trends. Your first task is to set up a Python environment for working with bookstore data—sales figures, book catalogs, and customer reviews. Yesterday, we refreshed our basic Python skills. Today, we’ll take the next step: installing the tools you’ll use daily, creating synthetic datasets like a book sales log, and learning about **DataFrames**—the data structure we’ll use to organize and analyze our information.

## 1. Setting Up Your Python Environment  
Before you can explore book sales or customer trends, you need the right tools. We’ll use:

- **pandas** – For managing and analyzing tabular data  
- **jupyter** – For interactive, notebook-style coding  
- **matplotlib / seaborn** – For visualizing your data  

**Why it matters:** Think of this like stocking your bookstore’s back office with the right software before your first big inventory check. Without the right environment, data analysis becomes slow and frustrating.  

**Installation (once per computer):**

```bash
pip install pandas jupyter matplotlib seaborn
```

Once installed, you can open Jupyter Notebook by typing:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This gives you an interactive place to write Python code, view data, and experiment with visualizations all in one window.

## 2. Understanding DataFrames & Synthetic Data Creation  

A **DataFrame** is like a spreadsheet inside Python—it has **rows** and **columns**, with column names describing your data. For example, if you import sales from a `.csv` file:

```python
import pandas as pd

books = pd.read_csv('books.csv')  # loads csv into a DataFrame
print(books.head())  # shows the first 5 rows
```

Expected output (your dataset will look similar):

```
   book_id                            title  author_id author_name    genre  price  publication_year  pages
0        1  A Journey Through Time             101   Alice Monroe  Fiction   12.99             2016    320
1        2  The Cooking Companion               102   Bob Rivers   Cooking  18.50             2018    250
...
```

**Why it matters:** You’ll run many `.head()` checks to make sure your data loaded correctly. Column names help you reference data easily—shorter names are better, just like source material suggests:

```python
books.columns = ['book_id', 'title', 'author_id', 'author', 'genre', 'price', 'publication_year', 'pages']
```

## 3. Generating Synthetic Book Sales Data  

Sometimes, you don’t have full datasets yet but you need to test your code. Let’s create **synthetic** (made-up) data with `pandas.DataFrame()`.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Generate a dummy book sales DataFrame
dates = pd.date_range(start='2024-01-01', periods=10, freq='D')
sales_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'sale_id': range(1, 11),
    'date': dates,
    'book_id': np.random.randint(1, 5, size=10),
    'quantity': np.random.randint(1, 5, size=10),
    'unit_price': np.random.choice([12.99, 18.50, 9.99], size=10)
})

sales_data['total_amount'] = sales_data['quantity'] * sales_data['unit_price']

print(sales_data.head())
```

Example output:

```
   sale_id       date  book_id  quantity  unit_price  total_amount
0        1 2024-01-01       3        4       18.50        74.00
1        2 2024-01-02       1        2       12.99        25.98
...
```

**Bookstore analogy:** It’s like filling in a pretend sales ledger to make sure your sales tracking software works before you hook it to the real cash register.

## 4. Saving Your Data to CSV  

Exporting data is essential for sharing results with teammates or backing up work.

```python
sales_data.to_csv('synthetic_sales.csv', index=False)  # saves without the index column
```

This will create a `synthetic_sales.csv` file you can open in Excel or Google Sheets—handy for sending to other departments.

---

## Common Pitfalls  

1. **Forgetting `import pandas as pd`**  
   *If you miss this, Python won’t recognize `pd.read_csv()` and your code will error.*  
   **Fix:** Always import the library before use.

2. **Long, messy column names**  
   *Referencing `Monthly car sales in Quebec 1960-1968` in every formula is painful.*  
   **Fix:** Rename columns to short, clear names before you start analysis.

3. **Using inconsistent data types**  
   *Mixing strings and numbers in the same column (e.g., `"12.99"` and `12.99`) causes errors in calculations.*  
   **Fix:** Check types using `df.dtypes` and clean your data.

## Practice Checkpoint ✅  

By the end of today, you should be able to:

- [ ] Install and run **pandas** and **Jupyter Notebook** on your computer  
- [ ] Load a `.csv` file into a **DataFrame** and inspect it with `.head()`  
- [ ] Generate a small synthetic dataset and export it as a `.csv` file

Tomorrow, we’ll dive into **exploring patterns** in our bookstores’ sales data—turning these tables into actionable insights.
