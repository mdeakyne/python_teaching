**DAY 4/21: Data Cleaning â€“ Handling Missing Reviews**  

Today I learned how to wrangle messy datasets by mastering **NaN handling** in Pandas. Missing values can hide important insights or worseâ€”distort themâ€”so getting this right is key.  

ðŸŽ¯ **Key Takeaway:** Thoughtful data cleaning is as much about preserving valuable information as it is about removing noise.  

ðŸ’» **What I Built:** Working with our `reviews.csv` file from *Page Turner Analytics*, I built a workflow to identify and handle incomplete records. Some reviews had no ratings, blank review dates, or missing purchase flags. I explored `dropna()` for rows where data was irretrievably incomplete, and `fillna()` to intelligently replace missing values. I also converted data types (e.g., from object to datetime), and cleaned up strings to ensure consistencyâ€”because "  Verified Purchase" with extra spaces isnâ€™t helpful for aggregation later!  

```python
reviews['rating'] = reviews['rating'].fillna(reviews['rating'].median())
reviews['review_date'] = pd.to_datetime(reviews['review_date'], errors='coerce')
reviews['verified'] = reviews['verified'].str.strip().fillna('Unknown')
```

ðŸ“ˆ **Progress:** 19% through the bootcamp and feeling more confident with Pandas' core cleaning functions.  

ðŸš€ **Tomorrow:** Hands-on with **Aggregation & GroupBy** to explore sales by genreâ€”turning clean data into actionable insights.  

ðŸ’¬ *Have you ever salvaged messy data that you thought was unusable? How did you approach it?*
