**Day 17/21: Callbacks – Making It Interactive 🚀**

Today I discovered how *callbacks* can transform a static dashboard into a dynamic, interactive experience. Instead of a single, unchanging view, the dashboard now responds instantly to user input — making data exploration not only faster, but more engaging.

🎯 **Key Takeaway:** Callbacks are the “conversation” between user actions and your application’s response — the bridge from input to insight.

💻 **What I Built:**  
I created a dashboard for *Page Turner Analytics* that updates daily sales charts and top-rated books as soon as a genre is selected. The user clicks on a dropdown, and behind the scenes, a callback function fetches filtered data, updates the charts, and refreshes the book list in real-time. I explored chaining callbacks to pass updated output into other inputs for even more seamless interactivity.

```python
@app.callback(
    Output('sales_chart', 'figure'),
    Input('genre_dropdown', 'value')
)
def update_chart(selected_genre):
    filtered = df[df['Genre'] == selected_genre]
    return px.line(filtered, x='Date', y='Sales')
```

📈 **Progress:** 80% through the bootcamp — three lessons away from the finish line!  

🚀 **Tomorrow:** Advanced Layouts — building a multi-page dashboard for bigger projects.
