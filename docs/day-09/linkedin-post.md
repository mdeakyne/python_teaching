**DAY 9/21: Seaborn Statistical Plots â€“ Distribution Analysis ðŸ“Š**

Today I explored **Seabornâ€™s statistical plots** to better understand data distributions â€” a key skill for turning raw numbers into actionable insights.  

ðŸŽ¯ **Key Takeaway:** Visualizing distributions can instantly reveal trends, outliers, and data quirks that raw tables might hide.  

ðŸ’» **What I Built:**  
I worked with a dataset of book prices and ratings to create histograms, box plots, and violin plots using Seaborn. Histograms showed how most books cluster around mid-range prices, while box plots highlighted a handful of premium editions as outliers. Violin plots gave a smooth representation of rating distributions, making it easy to compare genres side-by-side.  

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

sns.histplot(data=df, x="price", bins=30, kde=True)
sns.boxplot(data=df, x="genre", y="rating")
plt.show()
```

ðŸ“ˆ **Progress:** 42% through the bootcamp â€” almost halfway!  
ðŸš€ **Tomorrow:** Diving into **Plotly Express â€“ Interactive Basics** to bring static plots to life.

As a data storyteller, these visual tools are game-changers for communicating findings to both technical teams and stakeholders.  

ðŸ’¬ **Question:** Whatâ€™s your go-to visualization for spotting patterns quickly in a new dataset?
