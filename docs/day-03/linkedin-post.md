**DAY 3/21 – Data Selection & Filtering: Finding the Right Books 📚**

Today I discovered how to *zoom in* on the data that truly matters — by selecting specific columns, slicing rows, and applying smart filters with Pandas. It’s like going from scanning an entire bookshop to focusing on the one shelf that holds exactly what you’re looking for.  

🎯 **Key Takeaway:** Efficient data selection isn’t just about speed — it’s about revealing the *story* hidden in your data.  

💻 **What I Built:** Using a sample dataset of books, I practiced choosing relevant fields like title, author, and rating. Then I used boolean indexing to find all books with ratings above 4.5 and under $20. Finally, the `query()` method gave me concise, readable filter expressions — perfect for quick analysis.  

```python
# Selecting columns
books[['title', 'author', 'rating']]

# Boolean indexing
high_rated = books[books['rating'] > 4.5]

# Query method
affordable_hits = books.query('rating > 4.5 and price < 20')
```

📈 **Progress:** 14% complete — feeling momentum build!  
🚀 **Tomorrow:** Data Cleaning — Handling Missing Reviews.
